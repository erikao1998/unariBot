# UnariBot

UnariBot is a really simple Telegram bot created with [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/).

It's main (and currently the only) function is to tell the user what is on the menus in the student restaurants in Helsinki today. Now it is only running when I start the script locally but I am planning to put it on some server when I add more functionalities to it.
